# Corner-Grocer-Project
**Summarize the project and what problem is was solving?**
This project was made to help Corner Grocer track what has been bought in three different ways:
1. Display a list that shows all the items that were purchased and how many times they were purchased in a given day
2. Display a specifically searched item and how many times it was bought in a given day.
3. Diplay a histogram version of number 1

This project also assisted me in learning how to integrate two languages together, specifically Python and C++.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I feel that I debugged the program pretty well for my skill level. Integrating two languages together is very difficult when starting to learn so I was able to find where the bug was, research to help me fix the bug if I did not know how to fix it, and implement that fix accordingly. With this project, I learned how important it is to have certain files in the correct file so it can be accessed properly. 

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**
I could enhance my code by making it a bit more modular. I did not utilize header files in this project, though it was small. By using header files and making the code a bit more modular it would result in more secure code and possibly code that could be reused for the future.

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challaenging to write, and how did you overcome this?**
I found writing the file reading and opening and closing a bit difficult only because I was stressed in making sure I had closed the opened file. Also manipulating the C++ code to properly read the Python file address took some researching. I got an error that said something along the lines of the Python code not being found, I had to search up the error message and do some reading on what could have caused the problem and some possible fixes for that problem.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**
The skill of intricately integrating two separate programming languages together to work in harmony. This skill can most definitely be utilize in future projects especially bigger projects. Understanding where certain files need to be to be read by the program is also very important to avoid tedious bugs and errors.

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I made this program maintainable and readable by utilizing functions to the best of my ability. The functions keep the code compact and easily understandable. The use of comments greatly help the reader understand the thought process of certain parts of the code.
